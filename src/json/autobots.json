If it's not some internal gyroscopic malfunction in aircraft carrier mode that makes him seasick, it's vertigo in jet mode... and so on. The litany of grumbles and gripes never stops, which can be wearing on any Autobot assigned to work with him. But with mass-shifting abilities, a pulse-cannon and a Vibro-axe, Broadside more than compensates for the strain of partnering up with him. He's basically a one-'bot army.",
